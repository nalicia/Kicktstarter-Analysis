# An anylysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing  analysis on Kickstarter data to discover trends. 
## Overview of Analysis 
This week we learned the basic fundamentals of analyzing large data sets in Excel using conditional formatting, filters, functions, and pivot charts. After a refreshing review of Excels basic processes I set out to help Louise conquer her analysis-driven campaign. Louise wanted to know how the campaigns compared in relation to the outcomes of their fundraisisng goals and the conclusion of the campaigns. In order to assist Louise I had to make some modifications to the worksheet. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates
Our first step was creating a pivot chart to chunk the data we were looking for into a more readable format. Since we were looking for the outcomes of Theatrical campaigns I filtered the "Parent Category" to match "Theater" as well as filtering for the "Year" which consequentely produced the months of the year on the chart. Since we are comparing the outcomes of the campaigns, the date created and count of whether the outcomes were successful, failed, or canceled must be included.

The additon of this pivot chart makes our data easier to digest than the kickstarter  however it is not the full picture. In order to solidify the results of our analysis we needed to add another element. Graphical visualizations allow us to see trends that without looking purely at the numerical values.

Here our results are clear. The successful plays dominated in the early summer months with a natural digression through the fall. What I found interesting was the spike in failed campaigns and absence of canceled campaigns From September to November. After further review the spike makes sense. If the success rates are going down we can assume that the failure rates will go up. Also, there were no canceled shows in October. Apparently regardless of Friday the 13th the show must go on.
